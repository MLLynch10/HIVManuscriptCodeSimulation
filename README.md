# HIVManuscriptCodeSimulation
Folder includes the Cylinder-Bell-Funnel dataset downloaded from R package JMotif 07/20/2016
CBF data used in the simulation analyses that appear in manuscript “Ensemble clustering for longitudinal data: Bivariate HIV biomarker profiles to evaluate disease progression groups in prevalent cohort data”

Also included is script for taking the benchmark CBF data and generating the trajectory data subject to missingness at random (MAR); these data
are used in the simulations to compare cluster performance of two different inter-trajectory distance metrics (Frechet and DTW); script encodes the
mechanism of generating missing data
